## About The Project
This app implements a basic CRUD using NgRx for state management.  
It is designed as part of the *NgRx Fundamentals* course.

## Technical Aspects
- **In-Memory Backend**: The app uses Angular's In-Memory Web API library (angular-in-memory-web-api) to simulate a backend server.  
  Changes to data are not persisted and will be lost if you refresh the browser or restart the app.
