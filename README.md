## Technical aspects
Note there is no real back‑end server for this application. It uses the Angular in‑memory Web API library, which emulates a back‑end server and supports basic CRUD operations. Any changes you make to the data are only in memory. They are lost if you refresh the browser or restart the application.

## Usage
To run the site locally, clone this repository and navigate to the root directory. Then, install the dependencies with:<br />
`npm install`

Start the application with:<br />
`npm start`

## Version Information
The project was upgrate to use Angular v18 and NgRx v18.
